# C-DEngine NMI - The Modern User Interface of the C-DEngine

C-DEngine's User Interface - the Natural Machine Interface (NMI) - is a model driving user interface.
It allows developer to model and specify user interface components on the backend, sensors, machines or wherever the C-DEngine and plugins are hosted. 

Users can than access the NMI from other devices such as browsers, tablets or mobile phones using one of the renderers available on these devices. 

At this point only an [HTML5 renderer](src/HTML5/readme.md) is available but we plan on adding renderes for XAML, Xamarin, Unity and others.

+ If you want to have a look at the NMI you check out [Using Plugins](https://github.com/TRUMPF-IoT/cdeDocs/blob/master/docs/plugins/UsingPlugins.md).
+ If you want to use the NMI in your own application and get started coding for it checkout the [HelloWorld sample](https://github.com/TRUMPF-IoT/cdeDocs/blob/master/docs/Coding/HelloWorld.md).

Other repositories contain:

- the core [C-DEngine](https://github.com/TRUMPF-IoT/C-DEngine), 
- an [SDK with Samples](https://github.com/TRUMPF-IoT/cdeSDK), and 
- a collection of [turn-key Plug-Ins](https://github.com/TRUMPF-IoT/cdePlugins).
