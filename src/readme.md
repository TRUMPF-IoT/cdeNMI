## C-DEngine Natural Machine Interface

The NMI is based on a data model of classes sent to a renderer plugin across the mesh to create the user interface on demand.

This folder contains all renderer for the NMI.

### HTML5

The primary renderer for the NMI is based on HTML5 and runs in any browser.

### XAML ... anyone?

Anyone interested in building a XAML Renderer? We will post an early prototype of this renderer shortly

### Unity ... anyone?

Anyone want to help with this? 
No work has done here yet, but we love to get started
